    "## Know your audience\n",
    "- Third year students with a prior course in linear algebra\n",
    "- Prior exposure to programming recommended but not required\n",
    "- In person; we are going to tell ourselves that it's an active learning class\n",
    "- LMS agnostic\n",
    "- Access to Syzygy assumed\n",

    "## Big Ideas and Essential Questions\n",
    "- Main idea: Singular Value Decomposition is a very stable and fast algorithm with many applications in both math and industry, and it works with **any** matrix\n",
    "- Core understanding -- the decomposition provides us with lots of useful information:\n",
    "     - Four fundamental subspaces\n",
    "     - Rank\n",
    "     - Norm of a matrix\n",
    "     - Condition number: how changes in matrix entries can affect solutions\n",
    "     - Pseudoinverse, least squares\n",
    "     - Principal component analysis\n",
    "- Basic understanding: singular values are usually not nice: this is a numerical algorithm\n",
    "- Essential questions:\n",
    "     - How to compute it!\n",
    "     - How to use SVD to obtain all the information listed above\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "- How to implement SVD in Python using NumPy\n",
    "- Relationship between singular values and eigenvalues\n",
    "- To be able to prove the SVD theorem\n",
    "- What is so fundamental about the four fundamental subspaces?\n",
    "- Why is SVD the right way to compute rank?\n",
    "- How to apply the pseudoinverse to least squares solutions\n",
    "- Geometric interpretation of singular values\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning plan\n",
    "- Walk through the steps of the SVD algorithm in an example\n",
    "- Confirm that the results match what the built-in algorithm produces\n",
    "- Try the algorithm on a few more examples\n",
    "- Define the four fundamental subspaces, show how to find them from SVD\n",
    "- Do examples and confirm that SVD gives the same nullspace as \"old\" methods\n",
    "- Also use SVD to determine rank in these examples\n",
    "- Introduce pseudoinverse and have students work through an example\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook design\n",
    "- Code examples provided\n",
    "- Ensure students understand how to interpret output by comparing algorithm output to initial worked example\n",
    "- Students expected to modify/copy code for their own examples"
